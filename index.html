                What is a <em>cat</em>?
            </strong>
        </h1>
            
        <p>According to <b>Wikipedia</b>: <blockquote style="background-color:pink; font-size:1vw">The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family. A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.</blockquote></p>

        <h3>A catty poem:</h3>
        <pre style="color:darkgreen; font-size:1vw; background-color:pink; width: max-content;">
                <b><b>February</b></b>
                    by Margaret Atwood
                
                Winter. Time to eat fat
                and watch hockey. In the pewter mornings, the cat,
                a black fur sausage with yellow
                Houdini eyes, jumps up on the bed and tries
                to get onto my head. It's his
                way of telling whether or not I'm dead.
                If I'm not, he wants to be scratched; if I am
                He'll think of something. He settles
                on my chest, breathing his breath
                of burped-up meat and musty sofas,
                purring like a washboard. Some other tomcat,
                not yet a capon, has been spraying our front door,
                declaring war. It's all about sex and territory,
                which are what will finish us off
                in the long run. Some cat owners around here
                should snip a few testicles. If we wise
                hominids were sensible, we'd do that too,
                or eat our young, like sharks.
                But it's love that does us in. Over and over
                again, He shoots, he scores! and famine
                crouches in the bedsheets, ambushing the pulsing
                eiderdown, and the windchill factor hits
                thirty below, and pollution pours
                out of our chimneys to keep us warm.
                February, month of despair,
                with a skewered heart in the centre.
                I think dire thoughts, and lust for French fries
                with a splash of vinegar.
                Cat, enough of your greedy whining
                and your small pink bumhole.
                Off my face! You're the life principle,
                more or less, so get going
                on a little optimism around here.
                Get rid of death. Celebrate increase. Make it be spring.
